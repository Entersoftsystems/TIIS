====

The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW), supported by JICA developed the Training Institutions Information System (TIIS) in collaboration with EnterSoft Systems Ltd. The essence of developing TIIS is to address and strengthen the existing information system through coordination and networking of existing human resource for health data collection systems.     TIIS has a number of modules including the administration modules which allows the system administrator to create system users, define and edit new training cadres and courses and import data into the system. Data entry modules include course module, institution module for entering data related to contacts, lecturers, capacity, enrollment, assets and vehicles. Other data entry modules include the employee module with export and import functionalities to the HRHIS, the student module which allows you to enter student information and monitor the progress of the students. The last but not the least, is the module related to reports generated from the system. These include reports such as the overall health training institutions' contacts, courses, their capacities, employees, etc.
